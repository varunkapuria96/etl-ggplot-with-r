# The following code imports a CSV file 'GroceryTransactions.csv' which 
# contains grocery transactions data. The summary of the mean, median, SD, IQR,
# minimum and maximum values of Revenue are found using dplyr package.
# A new tibble is created containing only the selected fields and a few 
# filters are ran on the tibble.
# Another tibble is created containing a new feature called AveragePricePerUnit.
# A histogram of average price per unit and a boxplot of revenue are created.
